- Unlimited Undo/Redo
- ANSI/ASCII encoding (other sbcs and mbcs planned)
- View data as different basic types (int8/16/32/float/etc.)
- Text/hex/unicode search and replace (RegEx planned)
- Interpret and edit data as structure with C-like description
- Binary file comparison
- View data as bitmap
- Hash calculation (MD/SHA/CRC etc.)
- Scripting support (via MSScriptControl)
- Plugin support planned (via OleAutomation API)

Project is in early development stage. Use with caution and always make backups of valuable data!
