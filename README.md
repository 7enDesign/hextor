# Hextor

Hextor is a Hexadecimal editor and binary data analyzing toolkit.

It was created to make working with binary file formats as simple and convenient as with plain text. Although it is staffed with a powerful set of data analyzing tools, it starts instantly and rapidly works with files of any size.

Main features are:

- View data as different basic types (text/hex/int8/16/32/float/etc.)
- Interpret and edit data as structure with C-like description
- View/edit logical volumes, physical disks, process memory
- Unlimited Undo/Redo
- Bookmarks
- ANSI/ASCII encoding (other SBCS and MBCS planned)
- Text/hex/unicode search and replace with wildcards and value search
- Search and replace in files/directories
- Binary file comparison
- View data as bitmap
- Hash calculation (MD/SHA/CRC etc.)
- Disassembler (using Zydis library)
- Scripting support (via IActiveScript)
- Plugin support planned (via OleAutomation API)

Project is in early development stage. Use with caution and always make backups of valuable data!
